# Family World Cup Sweepstake HQ

Static GitHub Pages website for the family World Cup sweepstake.

## What it does

- Golden Boot leaderboard: total goals scored by each player's 3 teams.
- Best Average Team leaderboard: Tier 2 teams ranked by points, goal difference, goals for, games played.
- Current leader banner, wooden spoon watch, carrying-job stats, and automatic banter.
- Full player allocations with search.
- Completed scores section.
- World Cup group standings, ranked by points, goal difference, and goals for.
- Team goals tracker.
- Uses the actual England and Scotland subdivision emoji sequences in the data.
- Updates `data/results.json` automatically twice a day using GitHub Actions.

## Setup on GitHub Pages

1. Upload all files from this folder to your `worldcup-sweepstake` repo.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
4. Save.
5. Your site should appear at:
   `https://zburjony.github.io/worldcup-sweepstake/`

## Automatic updates

The workflow is in `.github/workflows/update-results.yml`.

It runs twice daily using UTC times:

- `0 20 * * *` = about 8:00am Auckland during NZST
- `0 8 * * *` = about 8:00pm Auckland during NZST

You can also run it manually from **Actions → Update World Cup results → Run workflow**.

## Data source

The script tries to fetch completed matches from:

`https://worldcup26.ir/get/games`

If the API is unavailable, it falls back to the initial score set included in the repo so the site still loads.

## Change update times

Edit `.github/workflows/update-results.yml` and adjust the cron lines. GitHub cron uses UTC.


## v4 update
- GitHub Actions now runs hourly.
- Golden Boot table is mobile-friendly: no G/G column and teams show as flag + three-letter code.

## v11 final Golden Boot mobile tuning
The Golden Boot table is back to five columns: `# | Player | Teams | ⚽ | GP`.
Flags are in their own Teams column.

To tweak mobile widths, edit `styles.css` and search for:

```css
--gb-mobile-rank
--gb-mobile-player
--gb-mobile-teams
--gb-mobile-score
```

These control the mobile Golden Boot column widths.
